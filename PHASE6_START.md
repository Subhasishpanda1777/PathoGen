# 🚀 Phase 6: Risk Scoring & Alerts - STARTING

## 📋 Plan

### 1. **Health Risk Score Algorithm**
- ✅ Calculate risk score (0-100) based on:
  - User's location (state/district)
  - Nearby disease outbreaks
  - Recent symptom reports in area
  - User's own symptom history
  - Infection index in user's region
- ✅ Risk level classification (Low/Medium/High)
- ✅ Factors breakdown and explanation
- ✅ API endpoint for user risk score
- ✅ Frontend display component

### 2. **Email Alerts System**
- ✅ Alert triggers (outbreak in area, high risk score, etc.)
- ✅ Email templates
- ✅ Scheduled alert checking
- ✅ User notification preferences
- ✅ Prevention measures suggestions
